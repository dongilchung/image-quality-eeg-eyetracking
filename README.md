This repository contains the data and analysis scripts used for our study on EEG and eye-tracking metrics, including saccades, blinks, and pupil size dynamics. This dataset and the associated scripts provide a comprehensive foundation for replicating our statistical analyses and generating the figures presented in the publication.

## Repository Structure and Detailed Contents
The repository is organized into three main folders: 0_data/, 1_figure/, and 2_analysis/. Below is a detailed description of the contents in each folder, including the scripts used for data processing, analysis, and figure generation.

- ```Behavior_arousal.mat```: This is behavior data for arousal block.
- ```Ch.brain.mat```: Numbering of 32 channel actiCAP EEG-System. Used to draw the graph of 31 channels of EEG information.
- ```Ancova_used_data.mat```: Contains data on pupil size and its temporal dynamics.

- ```Anal_eye_5_42_rating_lin_reg.m```: Analyzes the correlation between eye metrics and vividness ratings.
- ```Anal_eye_6_3_rating_lin_reg_pupil_time.m```: Examines the correlation between pupil size and vividness ratings over time.
- ```Anal_eye_7_2_1_residual_linear_reg_suppl.m```: Analyzes residual regression between eye metrics and vividness ratings.
- ```Anal_eye_7_3_1_residual_linear_reg_puptime_suppl.m```: Analyzes residual regression for temporal pupil size data.
#### Statistical Analysis in R:
- ```Anal_eeg_ANCOVA_1000times_random_sampled.R```: Runs cluster-based permutation ANCOVA for EEG.
- ```Anal_eye_ANCOVA_pupilTime_permu2.R```: Runs cluster-based permutation ANCOVA.
- ```Anal_eye_ANCOVA_eye_metrics.R```: Performs ANCOVA on eye metrics data.
- ```Anal_eye_ANCOVA_pupilTime.R```: Conducts ANCOVA on temporal pupil size data.
- ```Anal_eye_ANCOVA_pupilTime_posthoc.R```: Executes post-hoc tests following ANCOVA.
### Folder ```3_figure```:
This folder contains scripts for generating figures presented in the paper.
- **Figure 2(b)**: This code generates figure 2(b), about self-reports on the subjective vividness rating.  
- **Figure 4**: This code generates figure 4(a): Distinct EEG-patterns in response to three White-boosting modes, This figure contents involves cluster-based permutation analysis. This statistical analysis needs to load data by using Anal_Ancova_data_load_for_R_analysis.m and 1000times of ANCOVA analysis from R by using Anal_Ancova_1000times_random_sampled.R. Finally, Anal_cluster_based_permutation.m and Ancova_figure_analysis.m is used to present significant clusters in Figure 4(a).
